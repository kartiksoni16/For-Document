1. Environment Variable : 

	Environment variables are a set of dynamic values that can affect the behavior of software and operating systems. These variables are part of the environment in which a process runs and can be accessed and modified by applications or users. Environment variables provide a way to store configuration settings, system information, and other data that various programs and scripts can use.

	Here are some key points about environment variables:

	1. System Information: Environment variables store information about the system or the user running a program. This can include information like the user's home directory, the system's architecture, and the location of critical system files.

	2. Configuration Settings: Many software applications use environment variables to determine configuration settings. For example, a program might use an environment variable to determine the location of a configuration file, a temporary directory, or a database connection.
	Ex. If we need to change mode and with help of that cfg id we can di that.

	3. Security: Environment variables can store sensitive information, but they are typically accessible only to authorized users or applications. These variables can be used to store passwords, API keys, and other sensitive data.

	4. Interoperability (ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information) : Environment variables are used by various operating systems and programming languages. This makes them a common and accessible way to pass information between different parts of a system or between different programs.

	5. Accessibility: Environment variables can be accessed and modified by users and applications, which means they are an accessible way to make system-wide or user-specific changes.

	6. Examples: Common environment variables include `PATH` (used to specify directories to search for executable files), `HOME` (specifies the user's home directory), `USER` (the username of the current user), and `TEMP` or `TMP` (locations for temporary files).

	Environment variables are essential for system configuration, interoperability, and application behavior. They are often used in scripting and software development to make applications adaptable to different system configurations and user requirements.
	
	Ex. To store log in somewhere we give path on environment variable and fetch user log's from that place that have been mention.
	
	
	In Our Env have.
	> Db information
	> Site details
	> Configurations
	> Env Link
	

2. Formatters

		A formatter, in the context of programming and software development, is a tool or component used to automatically format or style source code according to a specified set of rules and conventions. Code formatting, also known as code styling or code beautification, involves making the source code more readable, consistent, and adhering to a standard coding style. Formatters are used to ensure that code is well-structured and follows established coding guidelines.

		Here are some key aspects of code formatters:

		> Consistency: Formatters help ensure that all code in a project follows the same coding style, making it easier for developers to read and understand the code.

		> Automated: Formatters are typically automated tools that can process source code files and apply formatting rules without manual intervention.

		> Indentation: One of the most common formatting tasks is the adjustment of code indentation (e.g., tabs or spaces) to represent code blocks and nesting clearly.

		> Whitespace: Formatters handle the placement of spaces and line breaks to make the code more readable and consistent.

		> Line Length: Some formatters can enforce a maximum line length to prevent excessively long lines of code.

		> Code Structure: Formatters can arrange code elements such as variables, functions, and classes in a consistent and organized manner.

		> Comments: They can also format comments, including aligning and spacing comments for improved readability.

		> Language-Specific: Many programming languages have specific formatters tailored to their syntax and conventions. For example, Prettier for JavaScript, gofmt for Go, and Black for Python.

		> Customization: Some formatters allow developers to customize the formatting rules to fit their team's coding style.

		> Integration: Formatters can be integrated into development environments (IDEs), build processes, and version control systems to enforce consistent formatting automatically.
		
		
		As we have one google-java-style doc for formatter.

6. Server and Configuration : 

		In Eclipse, a "server" typically refers to a runtime environment that allows you to deploy and test web applications, such as Java EE, Java SE, or other server-based applications. Eclipse provides tools for configuring and managing servers to simplify the development and testing of applications. Here's a detailed explanation of setting up a server in Eclipse, focusing on the Java EE context, with an example:

		 > Setting Up a Server in Eclipse:

		Eclipse IDE: Ensure you have Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers installed, as it includes server integration.

		Server Runtime: Eclipse supports various server runtimes like Apache Tomcat, WildFly, and IBM WebSphere. You need to download and install your desired server runtime separately.

		Adding Server in Eclipse:

		Open Eclipse.
		Go to the "Servers" view. If you can't see it, go to "Window" > "Show View" > "Other" > "Server" > "Servers."
		Right-click in the "Servers" view and select "New" > "Server."
		Select Server Runtime: Choose your installed server runtime (e.g., Apache Tomcat).

		Configure Server: You might need to configure server-specific settings, such as the server's installation directory.

		Add Projects: Add the projects (web applications) you want to deploy on the server. Right-click the server, select "Add and Remove Projects," and choose your project(s).

		Start the Server: Right-click the server in the "Servers" view and select "Start" to launch the server.

		Example - Configuring Apache Tomcat Server:

		Suppose you want to set up an Apache Tomcat server in Eclipse for a Java web application:

		Download Apache Tomcat:

		Visit the Apache Tomcat website.
		Download the binary distribution of Tomcat that matches your requirements (e.g., Tomcat 9).
		Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory on your machine.
		Install Eclipse IDE:

		If you haven't already, download and install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.
		Add Server in Eclipse:

		Open Eclipse.
		Go to the "Servers" view.
		Right-click in the "Servers" view and select "New" > "Server."
		Choose "Apache" > "Tomcat v9.0 Server" and click "Next."
		Server Configuration:

		Click "Browse" and select the directory where you extracted Apache Tomcat.
		Click "Finish."
		Add Your Web Project:

		In the "Servers" view, right-click the server and select "Add and Remove Projects."
		Select the Java web application project you want to deploy on the server.
		Start the Server:

		Right-click the server in the "Servers" view and select "Start."
		Access the Application:

		Once the server is started, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/yourwebapp to access your web application.
		By setting up a server in Eclipse, you can easily develop, test, and debug web applications within your IDE. It provides a convenient environment for Java EE development and simplifies the deployment process. The steps may vary depending on the server and application type you are working with, but the general process remains similar.
		
		After adding server and apache tomar if Project it's own configuration then we need to do as per projct configuration like port no and anruguments etc.
		
7. Workspace : 

		In Eclipse, a "workspace" is a fundamental concept that plays a crucial role in organizing and managing your development projects. It refers to the directory where your projects and associated files are stored. Here are the key details about workspaces in Eclipse:

		Workspace Location:

		A workspace is a directory on your file system where Eclipse stores all your project files, configurations, and settings.
		You choose the location of your workspace when you first launch Eclipse.
		Workspace Switching:

		You can have multiple workspaces on your system, each with its own set of projects and configurations.
		You can switch between workspaces based on your project needs. This is useful when you work on different projects or want to keep your work separate.
		Workspace Directory Structure:

		Within your workspace directory, Eclipse creates a specific directory structure to organize your projects.
		The default structure includes folders like "metadata" (workspace-specific metadata), "plugins" (Eclipse plugins), and "projects" (where project folders are stored).
		Benefits of Using Workspaces:

		Isolation: Workspaces provide isolation for different projects. Each workspace has its own project settings, preferences, and configurations.
		Organization: Workspaces help you keep your projects organized. You can have a separate workspace for each client, team, or project.
		Collaboration: You can share your workspace settings and configurations with others, making it easier to collaborate on projects.
		Creating a New Workspace:

		When you first launch Eclipse, it prompts you to select an existing workspace or create a new one.
		You can create a new workspace by specifying the directory where it should be located.
		Switching Workspaces:

		You can switch between workspaces from within Eclipse. Go to "File" > "Switch Workspace" to choose a different workspace.
		Eclipse will close the current workspace and open the selected one.
		Importing Existing Projects:

		You can import existing projects into a new workspace. Go to "File" > "Import" > "General" > "Existing Projects into Workspace."
		This allows you to work on the same projects in different workspaces without duplicating the project files.
		Workspace Mechanics:

		Eclipse stores workspace-specific settings, preferences, and project metadata in the workspace's "metadata" folder.
		Each workspace has its own set of preferences, so you can customize Eclipse for each project separately.
		Workspace Benefits for Developers:

		Developers working on multiple projects can keep their configurations and settings separate.
		Workspace isolation helps prevent configuration conflicts and allows for better project management.
		It's a useful feature for freelance developers, consultants, or anyone working on various projects simultaneously.
		In summary, a workspace in Eclipse is a designated directory where your development projects and associated files are stored. It offers a way to keep your work organized, isolated, and easily switch between different project contexts.
		
		
8. Editing and Refactoring : 

		Editing and refactoring are essential tasks in software development, and Eclipse provides a range of features and tools to make these tasks more efficient. Here's an explanation of editing and refactoring in Eclipse with examples in simple language:

10. Snippets : 

		In the context of Eclipse and programming, "snippets" generally refer to small, reusable pieces of code that can be quickly inserted into your source code. Snippets are especially helpful when you need to perform common coding tasks, implement design patterns, or write boilerplate code. Eclipse provides a feature known as "Code Snippets" to store and manage these code fragments for easy reuse.

		Why Snippets in Eclipse and Java?

		Code Reusability: Snippets enable you to reuse code segments, reducing the need to rewrite the same code multiple times. This saves time and effort and promotes consistency in your codebase.

		Efficiency: Instead of typing out repetitive code manually, you can insert a snippet with a few clicks. This speeds up development and minimizes the chance of errors.

		Best Practices: Snippets can be used to enforce coding best practices and design patterns. For instance, you can have a snippet for a standard Singleton pattern implementation.

		Learning and Documentation: Snippets can serve as documentation and examples for specific coding techniques or solutions to common problems. They can also help less experienced developers understand and apply certain code patterns.

		Using Code Snippets in Eclipse:

		Eclipse provides a feature called "Code Templates" for managing code snippets. You can access this feature through the Eclipse preferences. Here's how to use them:

		Creating a Code Snippet:

		In Eclipse, go to "Window" > "Preferences."
		In the preferences dialog, navigate to "Java" > "Code Style" > "Code Templates."
		You'll find a list of predefined code templates. To create a new snippet, click "New."
		Give your snippet a name and specify the code you want to insert.
		Inserting a Snippet:

		In your Java source code, type the abbreviation you assigned to the snippet.
		Press Ctrl + Space (or Cmd + Space on macOS) to trigger content assist.
		Select the snippet from the list, and Eclipse will insert the code for you.
		Managing Snippets:

		You can edit, delete, or reorder your snippets from the "Code Templates" preferences.
		You can also share your code templates with others by exporting them to a file or importing templates from a file.
		Example of Using a Code Snippet:

		Let's say you frequently need to create a getter and setter method for a class field. Instead of typing this boilerplate code each time, you can create a code snippet:

		Create a new code template in Eclipse preferences:

		Name: getter
		Pattern:
		java
		Copy code
		public ${field_type} get${field:field_name}() {
			return ${field};
		}
		In your Java code, when you need to insert a getter method for a field, type getter, press Ctrl + Space, and select the snippet. Eclipse will generate the getter method for you.
		
		
	> Create snippet go in window> view > other > Serch template 
		then create snippet as you need.
